# AgentX Development To-do

**Project**: AgentX - AI Agent Platform
**Status**: Prototype
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-29

**NOTE**: UI must be highly responsive between PC and mobile devices.

**Versioning**: `versions.yaml` is the single source of truth (run `task versions:sync` after
editing it). Completed work is tagged inline with the version it shipped in, e.g. `[v0.20.1]`.
Bump the version when a unit of work completes — patch for additive/back-compat features, and
bump `protocol_version` only on breaking API changes. Current: **0.21.8** (protocol 1).

## Phase 11: Deferred Items

> Remaining items from the memory system that didn't make the cut

- [ ] Optional LLM disambiguation for ambiguous entity matches (11.12.3)
- [ ] LLM timeout enforcement (requires async/sync architecture fix)
- [ ] Calibration factors: source, recency, corroboration, contradiction
- [ ] Negative reinforcement for corrected facts
- [ ] UI: "Where did I learn this?" — show original conversation from `source_turn_id`

---

## Phase 12: Documentation

> **Priority**: LOW

- [ ] Auto-generate API docs from OpenAPI
- [ ] Document contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add docstrings to all public functions
- [ ] Add type hints throughout Python code
- [ ] Document complex algorithms/flows

---

## Phase 13: UX Overhaul — Immersive AgentX (Complete)

> Moved to [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md). All items complete:
> - 13.6 AgentXPage with ConversationContext + ChatPanel
> - 13.10 Removed old tabs dir, renamed to panels, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+T/W/K), CSS pass
> - 13.11 Consolidation settings UI + TopBar integration

---

## Phase 14: Context Gating (Complete)

> All 14.1-14.7 complete. See [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md) for details.

---

## Phase 15: Plan Execution (Core Complete)

> **Goal**: Execute decomposed task plans instead of discarding them — subtask iteration, Redis state tracking, streaming progress events
> Core shipped (15.1–15.6 + cancellation). Moved to [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md):
> `PlanStateStore` + `PlanExecutor` (dependency-ordered subtasks, per-subtask trajectory
> compression, failure skip, synthesis), `Agent.run`/streaming integration, SSE plan events,
> and mid-execution cancellation. Only the deferred follow-ups below remain.

### 15.8 Fixes — shipped `[v0.21.8]`

- [x] **Executor looped on one subtask** ("step 3 of 9"). `Subtask.id` was used as a list index
      everywhere but `_parse_plan` set it from the LLM's `SUBTASK N` numbering, so non-contiguous/
      duplicate numbering made `mark_complete` flip the wrong slot → the running subtask never
      completed → re-selected forever. Fix: `_normalize_steps` reindexes to `steps[i].id == i` and
      remaps/sanitizes dependencies; plus a no-progress safety guard in the executor loop.
- [x] **Over-decomposition** ("giant plans for simple things"). `_assess_complexity` rewritten to
      require genuine multi-step structure (sequence markers / multiple action clauses / length),
      not a lone keyword; `planner.decompose` prompt now mandates the fewest subtasks (single-step
      allowed) with a hard cap; `planner.max_subtasks` (default 6) enforced in `_parse_plan`; default
      `complexity_threshold` raised to **complex**. Settings now seed the prompt editor with the
      live default (`/api/config` `planner.decompose_default`) + a Reset-to-default action.

### 15.7 Deferred Items

- [ ] Parallel subtask execution (independent subtasks could run concurrently) — **prerequisite now
      met**: the embedding request queue/serializer + cache shipped (`[v0.21.6]`,
      `kit/agent_memory/embedding_queue.py`), so concurrent subtasks' recall/embedding bursts are
      serialized safely. Remaining work is the parallel scheduler in `PlanExecutor` itself.
- [ ] Per-subtask reasoning strategy selection (use `_select_strategy` per subtask type)
- [ ] Subtask-level goal tracking (create subgoals via `parent_goal_id`)
- [x] Plan cancellation mid-execution — shipped. `PlanExecutor` checks `state.is_cancel_requested(plan_id)` between subtasks (`plan_executor.py:84,163`) and marks the plan `cancelled`; `POST /api/agent/plans/cancel` sets the flag.
- [ ] Plan resumption from Redis state after disconnect

---

## Phase 16: Multi-Agent Conversations

> **Priority**: MEDIUM
> **Goal**: Enable multiple agents to collaborate in shared conversation threads
> **Depends on**: Plan execution (Phase 15)

> **Agent Alloy** = the multi-agent system. **Factory** = the visual editor (frontend, not yet built).
> Control flow: supervisor agent owns the conversation; specialists are invoked via a `delegate_to` tool. Opt-in per chat request via `workflow_id`.

### Shipped (16.0–16.5) — moved to [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md)

- **16.0 Agent Alloy v1 backend** (2026-04-27): `alloy/` package, workflow model + `WorkflowManager` YAML CRUD, `delegate_to` tool, `AlloyExecutor` (shared `_alloy_<id>` channel, child goals, `delegation_*` SSE streaming, depth-limited re-delegation), supervisor framing prompt, `/api/alloy/workflows` CRUD, `alloy.*` config.
- **Parallel / fan-out delegation** + **trace/replay UI** (`[v0.20.1]`): per-delegation tokens/duration/cost/pricing-snapshot persisted; client `AlloyRunTraceModal` groups fan-out into runs.
- **16.1 Message attribution**: `agent_id` on `Turn` + `conversation_logs`; persisted across streaming/non-streaming/background and restored to display names.
- **16.2 Explicit routing** (`[v0.21.2]`): `target_agent_id`, `Session.participants` hydration, multi-agent awareness prompt.
- **16.3 Per-agent tool isolation**: `allowed_tools`/`blocked_tools` enforced in `_get_tools_for_provider`.
- **16.4 Ad-hoc agent-to-agent delegation** (`[v0.21.3]`): workflow-less `AlloyExecutor` mode gated by `alloy.allow_adhoc_delegation`, depth-limited, no self-delegation.
- **16.5 @-mention routing** (`[v0.21.4]`/`[v0.21.5]`): `agent/mentions.py` parsing, `AgentParticipant` Neo4j nodes + backfill migration, client `@`-autocomplete composer.

### 16.x Deferred / Next

- [-] Factory canvas frontend (Tauri client) — backend exposes everything needed
- [-] Declarative route execution (`on_complete`, `on_match:<predicate>`, `on_failure`) — schema accepted but ignored in v1
- [ ] Loop nodes (specialist iterates over a list)
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop checkpoint nodes
- [ ] Async delegation (specialist runs in background; supervisor continues other work)
- [ ] "User as supervisor" mode (no LLM supervisor — user manually invokes specialists from the chat UI)
- [ ] Tool-output sharing across agents (specialist's raw tool outputs visible to supervisor, not just final text)
- [ ] Per-workflow tool isolation (specialist inherits a *subset* of supervisor tools, not all)
- [ ] Trace UI follow-up: persist per-tool timing (executor currently stores one rollup turn per delegation → restored runs show delegation-level metrics only); fold specialist tokens into the supervisor done-event cost rollup
- [ ] Attribution follow-up: backfill historical NULL `agent_id` rows

### 16.6 Ambassador Agent (dual-presentation layer) — deferred sub-phase

> **Concept**: A customizable "ambassador" agent that mediates the human↔agent
> exchange as a *second presentation layer* alongside the chat UI — enriching
> communication with zero flow-disruption. Not a thin voice feature; a relay.

- [ ] Activation toggle for the ambassador (per-conversation or global).
- [ ] **Outbound (you → agent)**: capture continuous dictation while recording;
      on manual stop, convert the captured speech into a drafted message you
      **review/edit before send** (never auto-sends).
- [ ] Relay arbitrary additional inputs you attach alongside the dictated
      message — file inputs remain available (reuse the existing input path).
- [ ] **Inbound (agent → you)**: when an agent's final message lands, the
      ambassador produces a spoken/condensed **briefing** of the message plus any
      key elements sent with it (attachments, tool artifacts, citations).
- [ ] Customizable ambassador behavior (verbosity, persona, what to summarize vs.
      read verbatim, which key elements to surface).
- [ ] Zero UI flow-disruption: the ambassador augments, never blocks, the chat
      UI — design it as a parallel channel, not a modal step.
- Design later as its own sub-phase; sits naturally on the Alloy/multi-agent
  track (an ambassador is a specialist role mediating the conversation).

### Design Notes

- `agent_id` (Docker-style, e.g., "bold-cosmic-falcon") = formal routing identifier
- `name` (e.g., "Claude", "NodeManager") = flexible display name
- `Message.name` field carries `agent_id` on assistant messages — no provider schema changes
- Extend existing `agent/chat/stream` with optional `target_agent_id` — no new endpoints
- Memory already supports this: each agent recalls from `[channel, _self_{agent_id}, _global]`

## Phase 17: Seamless Server Management (Complete)

> **Goal**: Solid self-hosted server deployment + client connection tools.
> Complete (17.1–17.5). Moved to [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md): authoritative
> `ConfigManager` config, optional session auth (bcrypt + Redis sessions, `AGENTX_AUTH_ENABLED`),
> Docker production stack (`task prod:*`), multi-cluster deployment (`task cluster:*`), and strict
> client/API version matching (`protocol_version` + `VersionMismatchPage`). Android Tauri mobile
> shipped; rate-limiting + request-audit logging dropped in favor of the edge Gateway.

### 17.6 Open

- [ ] Cloudflare Tunnel deployment documentation (pending)

---

## Phase 18: UX Improvements & Optimization and Memory Tuning (In Progress, ~90%)

> Polish the client and tune the memory pipeline. Shipped waves moved to
> [roadmap.md](docs-site/src/content/docs/roadmap.md):
> **18.1** Wave 1 fixes (provider settings, mobile topbar) · **18.2** Toolkit (MCP server CRUD +
> tool browser, tags/groups/`allowed_agent_ids`, per-agent `allowed_tools`/`blocked_tools`) ·
> **18.3** Relay module (background-run inbox, "No Memorization" toggle) · **18.4** model metadata +
> `ModelPickerModal` (OpenRouter/Vercel capabilities + pricing) · **18.5** per-tab context bar +
> per-turn cost chip · **18.6** extraction tuning (entity resolution, `refines_fact_id` supersedure,
> scope context, `eval_consolidation` harness) · **18.8** Wave 2 fixes (KaTeX, table HTML, plan-step
> restore, editable cached servers, MCP auto-connect) · **18.9** memory tuning (`recall_user_history`,
> token-budget header, `checkpoint` tool + badge UI) · **18.10** plan/streaming reliability (token
> clamp, Plans drawer + step annotation, detached chat runs) · **18.11** client error contract +
> foundation cleanup (`ApiError`/toasts/`useApi`, Tailwind v4 + `ui/` primitives, god-component /
> `lib/api` / `ConversationContext` splits) · **18.11.x** cancel-CSRF + gate-page chrome fixes ·
> **18.12** Wave 3 entry-surface UX (Start recents, renamable conversations, selector redesigns,
> splash, README trim).

### 18.x Open / Deferred

- [ ] **Dashboard token + turn metrics** (18.5) — UI deferred; data layer ready. Assistant turns
      carry `model` + a `metadata` JSONB (tokens/cost/latency) in `conversation_logs`, so a dashboard
      card can aggregate via one `SELECT model, token_count, metadata FROM conversation_logs`
      (`idx_logs_timestamp` covers "today"). No further backend work needed.
- [ ] **Extraction eval-harness follow-ups** (18.6):
  - [ ] Procedural-memory eval cases (tool-usage/strategy learning) — once consolidation exercises that path
  - [ ] Snapshot/restore instead of `--wipe`, once memory export/import lands (see Backlog)
  - [ ] Persist eval runs (model, per-case scores, tokens) for cross-model / cross-prompt comparison
- [ ] **Extraction cleanup** (18.6): one-shot Neo4j script to dedupe entities created before the
      resolution fix; cross-channel entity unification; replace the regex correction patterns at
      `extraction/service.py:84` with an LLM-only path.
- [ ] **Working-memory follow-ups** (18.9): pin/anchor arbitrary turns, `scratchpad_note` tool,
      `inspect_working_memory`, active-goals header, `forget` tool, cached `user_recap_summary`
      rolling summary.
- [-] **Per-profile internal-tool gating UI** (18.9.x) — deferred. Backend `allowed_tools`/
      `blocked_tools` on `AgentProfile` exist but are unsurfaced; Toolkit "Access" only gates whole
      MCP servers and the profile editor has a single `enableTools` toggle. Building the per-tool
      allowlist surface is its own task (would also expose `checkpoint`/`recall_user_history`).

## Backlog (Future Enhancements)

> Items to consider after prototype is complete

- [ ] Fibonacci complexity planning scales (augment planning behaviour based on complexity)
- [ ] Disabled memory conversation prompt message banner - informs the model that memory is off for this conversation and the details are not persistent, and also that the conversation may contain confidential material.
- [ ] Nightly consolidation scheduler — persistent job scheduler (Django Q, Celery, or custom) with cron-like registration, restart survival, graceful shutdown
- [ ] Consolidation job logs endpoint (`GET /api/jobs/{id}/logs`)
- [ ] Real-time job progress (polling while running)
- [ ] Consolidation preview (`POST /api/memory/consolidate/preview`)
- [ ] Fact Transience (a confidence bias) — ranked on extraction for the predicted rate that the fact will be incorrect or irrelevant (e.g., "The user's home PC is slow" = high transience)
- [ ] Extraction example sets for LLM to see a large list of examples to compare from
- [x] GPU acceleration for translation models — shipped `[v0.21.6]`. Shared `kit/device.py`
      `resolve_device()` (`AGENTX_DEVICE`: auto/cpu/cuda/cuda:N); `translation.py` moves both NLLB-200
      + detection models `.to(device)` and moves tokenizer inputs onto it in both hot paths (they ran
      CPU-only before); `embeddings.py` passes `device=` to `SentenceTransformer`. Device surfaced at
      `GET /api/health` → `compute` + logged at load. Docs: Windows Setup + GPU Acceleration pages.
- [ ] Lazy model loading with progress indicator
- [ ] Multiple server support (user can log out of server, and into another one seamlessly)
- [ ] Cloud sync for memories
- [ ] Plugin system for additional tools
- [ ] Voice input/output
- [ ] Offline mode with cached models
- [ ] Cross-encoder reranking model for retrieval quality
- [ ] Memory export/import (JSON/SQLite backup) — also unblocks snapshot/restore for the consolidation eval harness (18.6) so it needn't `--wipe` a dev cluster
- [ ] Advanced memory visualization (interactive graph, embedding clusters)
- [ ] Streaming memory retrieval during chat
- [ ] Conversation sharing (read-only shareable links)
- [ ] Blocking tool call approval (pause stream, user approves/rejects before execution)
- [ ] Server authentication (single access key per server, session resume on reconnect)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive breakpoints and touch-friendly gestures
- [ ] Additional themes beyond cosmic (light theme, high contrast, etc.)
- [ ] Message injection into delegated tasks (agent interdiction tools)
- [ ] Custom window chrome — frameless Tauri window with our own title bar + window controls (minimize / maximize / close) and a drag region, styled to the cosmic theme. **Windows + Linux first; macOS later** (traffic-light insets + native fullscreen need separate handling). Touches `client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`decorations: false`) + a top-of-app titlebar component using the Tauri window API.

### Retrieval Quality Enhancements (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Working Memory Scratchpad — always prepend a structured scratchpad (current topic/task, active entities, recent corrections, open questions) to context for coherence/orientation
- [ ] Conversation Summarization — maintain rolling per-session and per-topic summaries; retrieval becomes `recent_turns + relevant_summaries + relevant_facts`
- [ ] Query Intent Classification — classify query before retrieval (follow-up → recency, callback → older history, new topic → broad semantic, factual recall → entities/facts); rule-based or lightweight LLM
- [ ] Negative/Correction Tracking — when `correction_detection_enabled`, mark superseded facts `temporal_context: "past"`, link corrections to originals, prioritize corrections in retrieval
- [ ] Fact Staleness Detection — add `expected_stability: transient|stable|permanent` and surface staleness warnings (relates to Fact Transience above)
- [ ] Multi-hop Entity Traversal — add a lightweight path-finding retrieval mode over the entity graph (e.g. User → works_at → Company → has_project → Project → uses_tool → Tool)

### MCP Tools (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Conversation MCP Tool — expose memory as MCP tools for external agents: `memory_recall(query, filters?)`, `memory_store(fact)`, `conversation_summary(conversation_id?)`

### Extraction Improvements (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Claude Sonnet for Extraction — switch extraction from local models to Claude Sonnet for better structured-output adherence, nuance detection, and entity resolution (cost/latency offset by async/batched consolidation)
- [ ] Improved Extraction Prompts — few-shot examples, better schema definitions, domain-specific tuning

## Known Future Issues

> Architectural concerns that may need addressing at scale

**Distributed Transaction Support**
- Dual-write to Neo4j + PostgreSQL has no transaction coordination
- Impact: LOW for single-user; HIGH for multi-user deployment

**Connection Timeout Configuration**
- Neo4j and PostgreSQL queries have no explicit statement timeouts
- Fix: Add `statement_timeout` to connection config

**Retry Logic for Transient Failures**
- No exponential backoff on transient database failures
- Fix: Add retry decorator with backoff for critical operations

**Rate Limiting on Memory Operations**
- No protection against rapid-fire memory operations
- Fix: Add per-user rate limits in AgentMemory

**Encryption at Rest**
- Conversation history and facts stored unencrypted
- Fix: Enable database-level or app-level encryption

**~~Query Embedding Caching~~** — RESOLVED `[v0.21.6]`
- Identical queries now hit an LRU+TTL cache (`EmbeddingCache`, keyed `(provider:model, text)`) in
  front of the queue (`kit/agent_memory/embedding_queue.py`). Tunable via `EMBEDDING_CACHE_*`.

**~~Embedding Request Queue / Serialization~~** — RESOLVED `[v0.21.6]`
- All embedding calls funnel through one process-wide daemon worker (`EmbeddingDispatcher` →
  `_EmbeddingQueue`, `kit/agent_memory/embedding_queue.py`): serialized so the thread-unsafe local
  model never runs concurrently, with opportunistic batching, bounded-queue backpressure, and
  exponential-backoff retry on transient (remote) failures. The public `embed`/`embed_single` API is
  unchanged, so all ~40 call sites were untouched. Lazy-started; bypassable via
  `EMBEDDING_QUEUE_ENABLED=false`. Covered by `EmbeddingQueueTest`.
