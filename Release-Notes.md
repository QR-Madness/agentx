<!--
  Human-written body for the NEXT release. The release action injects everything
  below the markers verbatim into the GitHub Release notes, between the title and
  the auto-generated "Supported server" / "Downloads" / "Docker image" / checksum
  sections.

  Before releasing:
    1. Bump `release-version` above to match versions.yaml (api.version / client.version).
    2. Replace the body below with the highlights/fixes for this version.
    3. `task release:check` verifies the marker matches versions.yaml.

AgentX is a self-hostable AI agent platform: a Django API server (MCP client,
layered agent memory, reasoning + drafting, model providers, translation) paired
with a cross-platform Tauri desktop/mobile client. This is the **Mobile-Ready
Alpha** — point the client at your own API server and bring your own model
providers (LM Studio, Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Vercel).

### Highlights

- **One-click releases.** Desktop installers and the API Docker image now build and
  publish from a single GitHub Action, with release notes authored in-repo.
- **Unified model picker.** Memory, planner, and prompt-enhancement settings now use
  the same full filterable model picker as the agent-profile editor (provider and
  capability filters, search, context/pricing metadata) — the old inline dropdown
  is gone.
- **Sturdier plan execution.** Plans restore and resume cleanly across a cold
  conversation load, terminate faithfully on Stop (interrupted vs. failed), and
  offer a resume nudge with the remaining lifetime.

### Fixes

- Web search is now bounded by a wall-clock cap so a slow provider can't wedge a
  turn or block cancellation.
- Plan resume rebuilds full context and no longer duplicates the user turn or leaves
  a stuck `running` status after an interrupt.

### Getting started

See the [documentation](https://agentx.thejpnet.net/docs) — the
[quickstart](https://agentx.thejpnet.net/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and
[self-hosting guide](https://agentx.thejpnet.net/docs/deployment/self-hosting) cover
standing up the server and connecting the client.
