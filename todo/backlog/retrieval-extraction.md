### Retrieval Quality Enhancements (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Working Memory Scratchpad — always prepend a structured scratchpad (current topic/task, active entities, recent corrections, open questions) to context for coherence/orientation
- [ ] Conversation Summarization — maintain rolling per-session and per-topic summaries; retrieval becomes `recent_turns + relevant_summaries + relevant_facts`
- [ ] Query Intent Classification — classify query before retrieval (follow-up → recency, callback → older history, new topic → broad semantic, factual recall → entities/facts); rule-based or lightweight LLM
- [ ] Negative/Correction Tracking — when `correction_detection_enabled`, mark superseded facts `temporal_context: "past"`, link corrections to originals, prioritize corrections in retrieval
- [ ] Fact Staleness Detection — add `expected_stability: transient|stable|permanent` and surface staleness warnings (relates to Fact Transience above)
- [ ] Multi-hop Entity Traversal — add a lightweight path-finding retrieval mode over the entity graph (e.g. User → works_at → Company → has_project → Project → uses_tool → Tool)
- [x] Memory graph relationship connections — shipped as a Fact↔Entity link tool. Backend
      `link_fact_to_entity`/`unlink_fact_from_entity` (user-scoped ABOUT MERGE/DELETE) +
      `POST/DELETE /api/memory/facts/{id}/entities`; `FactDetail` "Mentioned entities" section has a
      searchable, channel-scoped entity picker (link) + per-chip unlink, optimistically updating the
      fact. (Deferred: drag-to-connect directly on the ReactFlow canvas.)

### MCP Tools (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Conversation MCP Tool — expose memory as MCP tools for external agents: `memory_recall(query, filters?)`, `memory_store(fact)`, `conversation_summary(conversation_id?)`

### Extraction Improvements (migrated from docs/future-feature-pool)
- [ ] Claude Sonnet for Extraction — switch extraction from local models to Claude Sonnet for better structured-output adherence, nuance detection, and entity resolution (cost/latency offset by async/batched consolidation)
- [ ] Improved Extraction Prompts — few-shot examples, better schema definitions, domain-specific tuning
